          <p>Here's a taste of the book's first lines:
            <br/>
            "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time, Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point."</p>

          <h3>Gabriel García Márquez/Quotes</h3>
          <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of Him.</li>
            <li>What matters in life is not what happens to you but what you remember and how you remember it.</li>
            <li>Nobody deserves your tears, but whoever deserves them will not make you cry.</li>
            <li>The heart's memory eliminates the bad and magnifies the good.</li>
            <li>The interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own, serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever less free, ever more solitary.</li>
            <li>Life is not what one lived, but rather what one remembers, and how it is remembered to tell the tale.
            </li>
            <li>If God hadn't rested on Sunday, He would have had time to finish the world.</li>
            <li>Everything that goes into my mouth seems to make me fat, everything that comes out of my mouth embarrasses me.</li>

Still editing presentation to class, it wont be this long in the end. And it will be in Spanish

Hello class 
This is intended to be an informative and educational presentation, so I apologize ahead of time if you find this subject boring. 
Today will be speaking on Spanish-Literature authors whose books will change your literary worlds. As you will see they are a diverse group from different countries and are famous for different reasons. After a short description of each I will highlight two authors and give a little more detail into their writings and personality.
I have also decided to present this information through a simple website that I have created. It may not be a finished product but is sufficient for this presentation.
Julia Alvarez
First on the list is Julia Alvarez. Born in New York City in 1950, her parents returned to their native country, Dominican Republic, after her birth.  Ten years later, the family was forced to flee to the United States because of her father’s involvement in a plot to overthrow the dictator, Trujillo. 
Alvarez has written novels, collections of nonfiction, and numerous books for the young.
Alvarez has won many awards for her books for young readers.  In 2013, she received the National Medal of Arts from President Obama.
Isabel Allende
Next is Isabel Angélica Allende. Born in Lima, Peru, she is a Chilean writer whose works sometimes contain aspects of the genre magical realism. Allende has been called "the world's most widely read Spanish-language author. Allende's novels are often based upon her personal experience and historical events and pay homage to the lives of women, while bringing together elements of myth and realism. She has lectured and toured many U.S. colleges to teach literature. 

Carlos Fuentes
Carlos Fuentes Macías was known as "Mexico's most celebrated novelist". He was often named as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, though he never won.
Fuentes was born in Panama City. As his family moved for his father's career, Fuentes spent his childhood in various Latin American capital cities, an experience he later described as giving him the ability to view Latin America as a critical outsider. 
In 1938, Mexico nationalized foreign oil holdings, leading to a national outcry in the U.S.; he later pointed to the event as the moment in which he began to understand himself as Mexican. He first became interested in socialism, which would become one of his lifelong passions, in part through his interest in the poetry of Pablo Neruda. 
Mario Vargas Llosa
Next is Jorge Mario Pedro Vargas Llosa, born in 1936, he was a Peruvian writer, politician, journalist, essayist and college professor. 
 In 2010 he won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He writes across many literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers
Many of his works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian.  He has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. 
He initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, but later became disenchanted with its policies, after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971.
He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990, but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. He is also known as the person who coined the phrase, "Mexico is the perfect dictatorship."
Carlos Ruiz Zafon
Nest is Carlos Ruiz Zafón was born in 1964 but sadly has recently died in June 2020. He was a Spanish novelist best known for his 2001 novel La sombra del viento (The Shadow of the Wind).
Ruiz Zafón was born in the city of Barcelona. Growing up in Spain, he began his working life by making money in advertising. In the 1990s Ruiz Zafón moved to Los Angeles where he worked briefly in screen writing. 
Camilo Jose Cela
Next was have Camilo José Cela who was born in May 1916  and was a Spanish novelist, poet, story writer and essayist associated with the Generation of '36 movement.
He was awarded the 1989 Nobel Prize in Literature.
Camilo José Cela was born in Padrón, Province of A Coruña, Spain. 
His family was upper-middle-class and Cela described his childhood as being "so happy it was hard to grow up."
When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 Cela was 20 years old. His political leanings were were known to be conservative and he enlisted himself as a soldier but was wounded and hospitalized in Logroño.
Gabriel García Márquez
Next is Gabriel García Márquez who was born in March 1927 and was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist. Also known as Gabo or Gabito throughout Latin America. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, particularly in the Spanish language, he was Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. 
His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.
Jorge Luis Borges
And finally we have Jorge Luis Borges who was born in August 1899 and was an Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet and translator, and a key figure in Spanish-language and universal literature. His best-known books, Ficciones (Fictions) and El Aleph (The Aleph), published in the 1940s, are compilations of short stories interconnected by common themes, including dreams, labyrinths, philosophers, libraries, mirrors, fictional writers, and mythology. 
Borges' works have contributed to philosophical literature and the fantasy genre, and have been considered by some critics to mark the beginning of the magic realist movement in 20th century Latin American literature. 
He became completely blind by the age of 55. Scholars have suggested that his progressive blindness helped him to create innovative literary symbols through imagination. By the 1960s, his work was translated and published widely in the United States and Europe. Borges himself was fluent in several languages.
